## What is Cazuela?

Cazuela is a lightweight RESTful Framework written in PHP that allows you to export data to common formats such as JSON/XML/YAML. PDO used as data layer.

It can be used to interconnect systems, such as middleware platform, such as API layer or whatever you can think of!

## Requirements

- Apache 2.x or Nginx 1.x
- Rewrite mod (mod_rewrite)
- PHP > 5.3.x (with PDO, Reflection support)
- PHP DOMDocument (for XML parsing) 
- YAML module for PHP (if you pretend YAML support) 

## Supported Databases

For now only MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

## How to use? (Wiki is still under construction)

1- Change the connection settings in /app/config/Config.php

2- See the example service in the app/services/Test.php

3- Then in your favorite browser: http://domain/Test/getTest.(xml/json/yml)

4- If you pretend to serve multiple apps with one Cazuela installation, please change (for each app) the CAZUELA_BASE constant in app/webroot/index.php
