## What is Cazuela?

Cazuela is a lightweight framework written in PHP that allows you to export data to common formats such as JSON/XML/YAML. PDO used as data layer.

It can be used to interconnect systems, such as middleware platform, such as API layer or whatever you can think of!

## Supported Databases

For now only MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

## How to use? (Wiki is still under construction)

1- Change the connection settings in /app/config/Config.php

2- See the example service in the app/services/Test.php

3- Then in your favorite browser: http://domain/Test/getTest.(xml/json/yml)

4- if you pretend to serve multiple apps with one Cazuela installation, please change (for each app) the CAZUELA_BASE constant in app/webroot/index.php 

## TODO (in next version!)

- Console interface to cook a Cazuela
- ORM support
- SOAP and XMLRPC support (on study!)
- Oracle and SQLite database support
